# Learn about the wonderful projects students have been working on!

The Science and Innovation fair is an annual competition of science and engineering projects designed, developed, and displayed by students in grades 9-12. Participants share their creative abilities, knowledge, and interests with other students. Experienced judges critique the projects for qualities including scientific method, content, clarity of presentation, and originality.

Over the past few months national, state, and county coordinators have been actively discussing, planning, and protocols in response to current public health restrictions.
